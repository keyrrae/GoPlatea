# HackPlatea

In this project, we compared the performance of PHP interpreters with HipHop Virtual Machine(HHVM), as well as several popular programming languages and the corresponding runtime systems, such as PyPy for Python, HotSpot for Java, and Go runtime system.

For details of performance evaluation, please refer to *HHVM-Performance-Evaluation.pdf* in this folder.

We also have a web application--[HackPlatea](http://hackplatea.herokuapp.com/). This application allows a user to enter a PHP or Hacklang program, it will execute the program and return the result to the user.
